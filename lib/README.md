# Fundi App - Flutter Architecture

## Overview
Fundi App is a Flutter application built with a modular, feature-based architecture that follows best practices for scalability, maintainability, and user experience.

## Architecture Pattern
The app follows a **Feature-Based Architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

```

│   ├── constants/          # App-wide constants and configuration
│   ├── network/            # API client and network handling
│   ├── theme/              # App theme and styling
│   └── utils/              # Utility functions and helpers
├── features/               # Feature-based modules
│   ├── auth/              # Authentication feature
│   │   ├── models/        # User and auth-related models
│   │   ├── providers/     # Authentication state management
│   │   ├── services/      # Authentication services
│   │   ├── screens/       # Auth screens (login, register, etc.)
│   │   └── widgets/       # Auth-specific widgets
│   ├── job/               # Job management feature
│   │   ├── models/        # Job and application models
│   │   ├── providers/     # Job state management
│   │   ├── services/      # Job-related services
│   │   ├── screens/       # Job screens (list, details, create)
│   │   └── widgets/       # Job-specific widgets
│   ├── messaging/         # Messaging feature
│   │   ├── models/        # Message and chat models
│   │   ├── providers/     # Messaging state management
│   │   ├── services/      # Messaging services
│   │   └── screens/       # Chat screens
│   └── portfolio/         # Portfolio feature
│       ├── models/        # Portfolio models
│       ├── providers/     # Portfolio state management
│       ├── services/      # Portfolio services
│       └── screens/       # Portfolio screens
└── shared/                # Shared UI components
    └── widgets/           # Reusable widgets
```

## Key Features

### 🏗️ Modular Architecture
- **Feature-based organization**: Each feature is self-contained with its own models, services, and screens
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data layers
- **Scalable structure**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code

### 🎨 Consistent Design System
- **Green-based theme**: Professional color palette based on trust and growth
- **Reusable components**: Consistent UI elements across the app
- **Responsive design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind

### 🔒 Robust Error Handling
- **Centralized API client**: Single point for all network communications
- **Graceful error handling**: UI never breaks, always shows appropriate feedback
- **User-friendly messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Offline resilience**: Handles network issues gracefully

### 🚀 Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient state management**: Provider pattern for reactive UI updates
- **Lazy loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Image caching**: Optimized image loading and caching
- **Memory management**: Proper disposal of resources

### 🎭 Smooth Animations
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle animations for better UX
- **Page transitions**: Smooth navigation between screens
- **Loading states**: Engaging loading animations
- **Feedback animations**: Visual feedback for user actions

## Core Components

### API Client (`core/network/api_client.dart`)
- Centralized HTTP client using Dio

- File upload support

### Theme System (`core/theme/app_theme.dart`)
- Material Design 3 implementation
- Green-based color palette
- Consistent typography
- Component-specific styling
- Dark mode support (ready)

### State Management (Feature-based Providers)
- **AuthProvider** (`features/auth/providers/`): Manages user authentication state
- **JobProvider** (`features/job/providers/`): Handles job-related state and operations
- **MessagingProvider** (`features/messaging/providers/`): Manages chat and messaging state
- **PortfolioProvider** (`features/portfolio/providers/`): Handles portfolio state and operations
- Provider pattern for reactive UI updates
- Feature-based state management for better organization

### Reusable Widgets (`shared/widgets/`)

- **AppInputField**: Form inputs with validation
- **LoadingWidget**: Loading states and shimmer effects
- **ErrorWidget**: Error handling and empty states

## Feature Modules

### Authentication Feature (`features/auth/`)
- **Models**: User model with roles and status
- **Services**: Login, registration, profile management
- **Screens**: Login, register, forgot password
- **Security**: Token-based authentication

### Job Management Feature (`features/job/`)
- **Models**: Job and application models
- **Services**: CRUD operations for jobs and applications
- **Screens**: Job list, details, creation
