Got it! Here‚Äôs the refined mobile app design documentation where customers and fundis use the same UI, with role-specific actions appearing contextually (e.g., FAB for posting jobs only visible to customers, ‚ÄúApply‚Äù button visible to fundis).

üì± Fundi App ‚Äì Unified Mobile UI for Fundis & Customers

1. Design Principles
Single UI for both roles to reduce complexity.


Contextual actions based on user role:


Customer: Post jobs, view applications.


Fundi: Apply to jobs, view portfolio.


Clean, intuitive layout with minimal role switching friction.


Consistent navigation, colors, typography, and card designs.



2. Navigation
2.1 Bottom Navigation Bar
Home / Feed: Job listings (all users)


Jobs: My jobs / applied jobs (contextual)


Portfolio: Fundi portfolios (for customers, view only; fundis, manage/upload)


Messages: Chat system


Profile: Account, verification, payment/subscription


2.2 Floating Action Button (FAB)
Visible only for actions allowed per role:


Customer: FAB ‚Üí Post Job


Fundi: FAB ‚Üí Add Portfolio (optional)


FAB always contextually visible on relevant screens


2.3 Menu Drawer (Hamburger Menu)
Accessible from top-left


Unified menu items:


Home / Feed


My Jobs


Portfolio


Favorites (Customer) / Achievements (Fundi)


Notifications


Payments / Subscriptions


Settings


Logout



3. Screens
3.1 Authentication & Onboarding
Splash Screen ‚Üí Onboarding Slides ‚Üí Signup / Login


Role selection at signup determines contextual actions later


NIDA verification mandatory for fundis


Optional VETA certificate upload



3.2 Home / Feed
Job cards: title, location, brief description, budget, status


Sorted by location & category


For customers, each card shows fundi list & application status


For fundis, card shows ‚ÄúApply‚Äù button if eligible



3.3 Job Posting & Applications
Single Job Detail UI:


Display budget, requirements, attachments, deadline


Customer sees list of fundi applications


Fundi sees ‚ÄúApply‚Äù form with budget breakdown & estimated time


Status Indicators: Pending, In Progress, Completed, Rejected



3.4 Portfolio
Fundis can upload/manage media


Customers can view verified fundi portfolios


Sliding gallery for images/videos


Optional details: skills, time spent, budget



3.5 Messages
Unified chat system


Chat list + conversation screen


Push notifications for new messages



3.6 Profile & Settings
Unified profile screen:


Name, phone, NIDA/VETA, role, job statistics


Subscription/payment info


Notification settings, theme, logout



4. UI/UX Considerations
Single design: Role-based actions appear contextually


FAB & buttons adapt to user role


Job cards and portfolio cards consistent for both users


Color-coded statuses: Pending (yellow), In Progress (blue), Completed (green), Rejected (red)


Location-aware feeds for job/fundi proximity


Push notifications for relevant role-specific events



5. Job Lifecycle
Customer posts job ‚Üí Fundi sees job ‚Üí Fundi applies ‚Üí Customer reviews ‚Üí Accept/Reject ‚Üí
Job In Progress ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Customer rates fundi

Unified UI displays relevant actions based on current role and job status


Notifications guide users at each step



6. Technical Considerations
Offline support: Cache job feed, portfolio media


Lazy loading: For images/videos


Media storage: AWS S3 / Firebase Storage


Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging


Role-aware FAB & buttons: Conditional rendering based on user type


Budget handling: Display breakdown JSON for each job application



‚úÖ Outcome:
Single UI for all users


Contextual actions prevent confusion


Consistent design reduces learning curve


Both customers and fundis can switch roles seamlessly (optional future feature)
